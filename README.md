SuperCodingBall is a free educational game, which aims to introduce programming, through the theme of football!

The player will train a team of 4 footballers (the humans) who will face 4 monsters.

The team's strategy is made with blocks ([Scratch-like](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor)),
then the game takes place automatically following the strategies of the two opponents.

# Mobile

SuperCodingBall can be played on a mobile device or a computer (in this case, the blocks are displayed next to the football field).

On an Android or iOS device, one can install the application as [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps) (it allows to play even without connection).

# Offline vs online

There are two game modes:
* local play, against the computer (with some pre-defined strategies)
* online play, against other players (requires internet connection)

For online play, SuperCodingBall uses the [Webcom service](https://datasync.orange.com) to store player information.
This is a service reserved for [Orange](https://www.orange.com) developers, but it can be easily replaced by any other "Backend As a Service" (like Firebase).

There are 3 options to connect:
* As a guest (does not allow using multiple devices)
* With a Facebook account
* With a Google account

In all cases, SuperCodingBall will store the (modifiable) nickname, the blocks and the results of the games played.

At any time, players can delete their account.

## Blockly

SuperCodingBall uses Google's excellent [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) library to manage interactions with blocks.

To generate the personalized blocks, you can use the [Blockly Developer Tools](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html), the source of the blocks being stored [here](./src/assets/blocks/library.xml).

Once the [blocks.json file](./src/assets/blocks/blocks.json) has been generated, it must be modified to add styles and translations.

## Sprites creation

All player sprites come from the "Open Game Art Liberated Pixel Cup" and were generated by [this tool](https://github.com/sanderfrenken/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator):
